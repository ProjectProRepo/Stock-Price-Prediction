# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository demonstrates a Machine Learning project for predicting stock prices using time-series data. Stock price prediction has always been a challenging and intriguing domain due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of financial markets. The project uses historical stock data and machine learning models to predict short-term fluctuations in stock prices.
While the market is influenced by numerous factors—both quantifiable (historical prices, trading volumes) and qualitative (corporate strategies, news, and economic conditions)—this project focuses on extracting patterns from quantifiable data to make probabilistic short-term predictions.
## Key Highlights

- **Model**: A simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network built using Keras in Python.
- **Dataset**: Historical stock price data for Netflix from March 2019 to March 2022. The dataset has been sourced from [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/)
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how machine learning models can predict market behavior for average, uneventful trading days, without aiming for perfect precision due to inherent market uncertainties.
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

 1. Clone this repository

 2. Install the required libraries

 3. Load the dataset and preprocess the data

 4. Train the LSTM model and evaluate its performance
